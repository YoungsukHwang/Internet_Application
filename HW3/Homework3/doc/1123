The A-Z of Conspiracy
As everyone knows, we are never allowed to know who is really
controlling our lives/the country/the world.  But is this knowledge a
dangerous thing? To clear up this question beyond reasonable doubt
Life provides a comprehensive guide to the theoretical corridors and
sinister back offices in which true power (and general paranoia) may
(or may not) lie

THE GUARDIAN  
  
   Conspiracy theories are the will-o'-the-wisps of the modern
world. They provide an alternative history to the authorised
version of events, a coherent demonology in a godless, devil-less
age.
   Conspiracy theories fill a human need. They make some sense of
the cruel narrative that is the <DATE>20th century</DATE>. They turn the random
violence of a lone madman into an act of orchestrated malice. In
this way the loss of a figure like <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> becomes somehow more
comprehensible. To be angry is more bearable than to be uncertain.
   This soothing function can be at odds with truth, however.
Alternative conspiracist history is as flawed as the `authorised'
version. Worse, a conspiracist view can suppress awkward pieces of
information by toying with the notion that events have been covered
up by the authorities to suit their own ends: encounters with alien
space ships, the real makers of the <LOCATION>Lockerbie</LOCATION> bomb and the truth
about <PERSON>Rudolf Hess</PERSON> have all been hidden from the public but the
higher officers of the state are in the know.
   Some of the conspiracy theories which date from earlier this
century have more ignoble, murkier origins. Anti-semites were
behind the Protocols of the <ORGANIZATION>Elders of Zion</ORGANIZATION>, the Jewish Conspiracy
and countless others. Their modern equivalents are put about by
neo-Nazi cliques. Again, these conspiracy theories have a human
function. Failure in life is more bearable if `the truth' is that
the Jews/the blacks/the Illuminati have conspired against you, it
allows you to ignore the fact that you are a spotty social
inadequate with bad breath and too-tight lederhosen.
   The conspiracy theorist is the bane of the working journalist.
The need for some sliver of evidence to support assertions is
secondary to the spell of the theory: that, for the conspiracy
theorist, is its charm. This difficulty is compounded by the fact
that not all conspiracy theories are untrue. Those in power across
the world do prefer to keep embarrassing truths secret; they do
cover up; they do, from time to time, kill people who get in the
way.
   True or not, a rattling good conspiracy theory requires the
following qualities:

   1 it must be difficult, better still, impossible, to understand
at first glance.
   2 it must contain a spaghetti-heap of leads, all of which cannot
be followed up. There must always be one more lead left to chase.
   3 The story should speak to a `wider' truth about our society,
through a series of disconnected or unconnected or unfalsifiable
propositions.
   4 There should be no easy way of verifying it.

   The theories below demonstrate all of these qualities to a
greater or lesser degree. To savour our A-Z properly, we suggest
readers mull over it with deadpan credulousness in the small hours
of the morning listening to the theme music from The X-Files and
drinking black coffee.
   A IS FOR ALIEN ENCOUNTERS that are being covered up by the
authorities. Perhaps the best-documented close encounter of the
third kind took place on 27 <DATE>December 1980</DATE>, when airmen at two <ORGANIZATION>RAF</ORGANIZATION>
stations in <LOCATION>East Anglia</LOCATION> witnessed something extraordinary. First
radar operators at <ORGANIZATION>RAF Watton</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> picked up an oddity on
their screens. Then <ORGANIZATION>RAF</ORGANIZATION> Phantom pilots reported seeing intense
bright lights in the sky. Former radar operator <PERSON>Mal Scurrah</PERSON> said:
`As the Phantoms got close the hovering object shot upwards at
phenomenal speed " monitored at more than 1,000 mph.' Later, airmen
stationed at <ORGANIZATION>RAF Woodbridge</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Suffolk</LOCATION> investigated a mystery fire
in Rendlesham Forest. Sergeant <PERSON>Jim Penniston</PERSON> witnessed the
encounter with airman <PERSON>John Burroughs</PERSON>. <PERSON>Penniston</PERSON> said: `The air was
filled with electricity and we saw an object about the size of a
tank. It was triangular, moulded of black glass and had symbols on
it. Suddenly it shot off faster than any aircraft I have ever
observed.' The next day the object returned. Base commander Lt Col
Charles Halt saw the flying saucer himself: `I couldn't believe
what I was seeing. It looked like the rising sun with a black
pulsating centre. It appeared to be dripping molten metal.' Hall
acted coolly, taping and photographing the object engineered by `an
intelligence which didn't originate on Earth'. His tape and film
were confiscated by visiting <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> defence officials. Former British
Chief of <ORGANIZATION>Defence Staff Lord Hill-Norton</ORGANIZATION> has claimed: `Someone is
sitting on information that should be in the public domain.'
Believability: 9/10 (Possible explanation: what the airmen saw may
not have been a UFO, but a prototype of the Stealth bomber, which
has a black triangular shape, a strange radar print and was, in
<DATE>1980</DATE>, ultra-secret. Project <LOCATION>Aurora</LOCATION>, a new ultra-ultra-secret
<ORGANIZATION>Pentagon Black Budget</ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance aircraft, is probably
responsible for all subsequent UFO sightings.)

   B IS FOR THE BILDERBERG GROUP, which organises semi-secret
annual three-day meetings of the European-Atlantic great and good
from the worlds of business, diplomacy and politics. The first
meetings were organised in <DATE>1954</DATE> by eminence grise <PERSON>Joseph Retinger</PERSON>,
the then secretary general of the newly fledged, CIA-funded
European Movement. <PERSON>Karl Otto Pohl</PERSON>, then president of <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche
Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>David Rockefeller</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lord Carrington</PERSON> and Governor <PERSON>Bill
Clinton</PERSON> of Arkansaswere among recent delegates. <PERSON>Denis Healey</PERSON> was at
that first meeting and, having retired, discusses Bilderberg in his
autobiography, The Time Of My Life. Bilderberg is one of the
transnational groups suspected by the European-American far Right
of being part of the secret elite power structure. Even the
<ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> column `Lombard' has noted: `If the Bilderberg
group is not a conspiracy of some sort, it is conducted in such a
way as to give a remarkably good imitation of one.' Believability:
8/10
  
   C IS FOR CEAUSESCU, who was tried and executed on <DATE>Christmas Day</DATE>
to hush up the complicity of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s new leaders in his crimes.
The videotape of the Christmas Day show trial of Nicolae and <PERSON>Elena
Ceausescu</PERSON> is an absorbing spectacle. Time and again, <PERSON>Ceausescu</PERSON> and
his wife turn on their interrogators and accuse them of knowing the
answers to the questions they have posed. Prosecutor: `What do you
know about the Securitate?' Elena: `They are sitting across from us
here.' The old witch was right, of course, because sitting in the
courtroom were secret police chiefs like <PERSON>Colonel Magureanu</PERSON>, who had
been party to the attack on civilians in <LOCATION>Timisoara</LOCATION> which had
triggered the revolution. He was later promoted by the leader of
the conspirators, <LOCATION>Ion Iliescu</LOCATION> " a former <PERSON>Ceausescu</PERSON> crony " to head
the renamed secret police, the `<ORGANIZATION>Romanian Information Service</ORGANIZATION>'.
Iliescu became and remains president, the tainted hero of a tainted
revolution.
   Believability: 10/10

   D IS FOR `DEEP THROAT', the mole in the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> administration
guiding the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post journalists, <PERSON>Woodward</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bernstein</PERSON>, to
the Watergate story. `Throat' remains unidentified. In his book
Hidden Agenda (<DATE>1984</DATE>) <PERSON>Jim Hougan</PERSON> nominated both <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s chief of
staff, <PERSON>Alexander Haig</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>National Security Agency</ORGANIZATION> boss, Admiral
<PERSON>Bobby Ray Inman</PERSON>, as candidates; <PERSON>Colodny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gettlin</PERSON> also fingered
<ORGANIZATION>Haig</ORGANIZATION> in their book Silent Coup (<DATE>1991</DATE>). <PERSON>Barbara Newman</PERSON>, for Channel
4's Dispatches, came up with the head of the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> field office in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the late <PERSON>Bob Kunkle</PERSON>. He was allegedly leaking for the
<ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, which was disgruntled by the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> cover-up.
   Believability: 10/10 (Cynics suspect `Deep Throat' was merely a
dramatic device or a ploy to keep newspaper lawyers quiet.)

   E IS FOR ELECTRICITY PYLONS, which fry our brains. A number of
protesters have complained that electro-magnetic waves in overhead
electricity pylons have led to depression, headaches, mental and
physical ill-health. No government ministry has placed much
credence on these complaints. The epidemiology of environmental
effect is notoriously hard to prove, but all good conspiracists
believe there is no smoke without a secret ray.
   Believability: 7/10

   F IS FOR FREEMASONS, who club together to better themselves in
the world. The majority of active freemasons have sworn not to
divulge the secrets of the craft, on pain of having their tongues
`cut out by the root and buried in the sand below low-water mark'.
Other masons who have tried to break ranks have come to sticky
ends, like `God's Banker' <PERSON>Roberto Calvi</PERSON>, found hanging from
Blackfriars Bridge in <DATE>1982</DATE>. So it is hard to determine just how
much influence is wielded by the grown men who like to dress in
black suits, wear aprons, bare their breasts and roll up their
trouser legs. Not very much, say some sceptics, who suspect that
the masons have more control over, say, haberdashery in
<LOCATION>Herefordshire</LOCATION> than the British state. But freemasons still hold
some sway in the corridors of power. The Rt Hon the <PERSON>Lord Templeman</PERSON>
and <ORGANIZATION>Rt Hon Lord Justice Balcombe</ORGANIZATION>, both freemasons, are two of the
most senior judges in the land; junior Foreign Office minister <PERSON>Tony
Baldry</PERSON>, former Tory MP <PERSON>David Trippier</PERSON> and back bench MPs Sir <PERSON>Peter
Emery</PERSON> and Sir <PERSON>Gerard Vaughan</PERSON> are all on the square.
   Many police officers, too, remain true to their masonic oaths of
secrecy. In <DATE>1993</DATE> at a <ORGANIZATION>Police Federation</ORGANIZATION> conference a motion urging
police officers to reveal membership of the masonic brotherhood was
debated. An officer from <LOCATION>Merseyside</LOCATION> said it did not matter if
officers `wore a goatskin or rolled up their trouser leg'. Another
said that freemasonry was `not all mumbo-jumbo'.
   A third police officer, mocking the calls for more openness
about freemasonry in the ranks, put a paper bag over his head.
Finally a member of the Metropolitan branch came to the rostrum to
announce the vote. `I'm not telling,' he said to laughter. `It's a
secret.' The opponents of freemasonry lost the vote.
   Believability: 8/10

   G IS FOR THE GEMSTONE FILE, the conspiracy theory which first
surfaced in <DATE>1975</DATE>. Originally a precis by American journalist
<PERSON>Stephania Caruana</PERSON> of allegations made in letters by American
chemist <PERSON>Bruce Roberts</PERSON>, now deceased, Gemstone attributes much of
post-war <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s ills to the power of <PERSON>Aristotle Onassis</PERSON>, who had
the Kennedys and Dr King assassinated, seized the <PERSON>Howard Hughes</PERSON>
empire, did a deal with the <LOCATION>Mafia</LOCATION>, etc. The subject of a couple of
book-length studies to date, Gemstone has appeared in five or six
different versions, each one containing new material. Most striking
is the `<ORGANIZATION>Kiwi Gemstone</ORGANIZATION>' in which specifically <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> incidents
have been embedded in the original American narrative. Authorless,
floating round the world in samizdat form, Gemstone is a perfect,
small-scale disinformation vehicle for anyone who cares to use it.
   Believability: 0/10

   H IS FOR <ORGANIZATION>HESS</ORGANIZATION>, locked up in <LOCATION>Spandau</LOCATION> prison because he knew all
about the secret <DATE>1941</DATE> negotiations between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nazi
Germany</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Rudolf Hess</PERSON>'s flight in <DATE>May 1941</DATE> remains one of the most
bizarre episodes of the Second World War. Lord <PERSON>James
Douglas-Hamilton</PERSON>, son of the <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Hamilton</ORGANIZATION>, the Scottish
landowner to whom <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> presented his plans, said: `<PERSON>Hess</PERSON>'s proposals
consisted of a limited peace deal under which <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> would have
allowed <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> a free hand in her empire in return for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
allowing <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> a free hand in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. His so-called
peace plans would have meant the enslavement of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.' <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> was
arrested, tried to commit suicide, went mad, was sentenced to life
imprisonment and, at the age of 93, hanged himself in <LOCATION>Spandau</LOCATION>
prison. Or not, as the case may be.  
   One theory has it that the Churchill government, in a hideously
clever propaganda campaign against the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>, ran a double, `Hess
Two'. Evidence supporting the double theory emerged when a Dutch TV
journalist, <PERSON>Karel Hille</PERSON>, disclosed that he had got the Most Secret
file on <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> via an unnamed British historian who had been given it
by the late MI6 spymaster Sir <PERSON>Maurice Oldfield</PERSON>. Oldfield had,
allegedly, stolen the file from the MI6 archive. That the man,
`<PERSON>Hess</PERSON> Two', who killed himself in prison was not the real <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> is
backed by <PERSON>Hugh Thomas</PERSON>, a Welsh surgeon, who, in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>,
was consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>British Military Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Berlin</LOCATION>.
Thomas examined `<PERSON>Hess</PERSON> Two' and found him to lack the scars the real
<PERSON>Hess</PERSON> should have had after a wound he received in <DATE>1917</DATE>. MI6 had
`<PERSON>Hess</PERSON> Two' hanged because they didn't want the truth to come out.
Then the killers burnt the evidence, including an electrical flex,
with which he was murdered.
   Believability: 5/10 (<PERSON>Hess</PERSON> was mad. His <DATE>1917</DATE> wound was
pea-sized.)

   I IS FOR THE ILLUMINATI, the secret society controlling all the
other secret societies. An 18th-century masonic splinter group
begun by <PERSON>Adam Weishaupt</PERSON>, the Illimunati were said to be the hidden
force behind the French Revolution. After the First World War they
were re-launched into the English-speaking world by one <PERSON>Nesta
Webster</PERSON> who credited them with organising the Russian <DATE>October</DATE>
Revolution too. In <DATE>1921</DATE> the Spectator described <PERSON>Weishaupt</PERSON> as a
`Prussian with criminal instincts and lunatic perversions . . .
{who} shunted continental freemasonry on to Antinomian and
revolutionary lines.' In the demonology of the Anglo-American far
Right, the Illuminati largely replaced the Jews as the spider at
the centre of the web. These theories were brilliantly parodied in
the Illuminatus! trilogy (<DATE>1976</DATE>) by <PERSON>Robert Anton Wilson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert
Shea</PERSON>.
   Believability: 0/10

   J IS FOR <PERSON>JAMES JESUS ANGLETON</PERSON>, the orchid-growing,
poetry-writing, paranoid head of <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> counter intelligence
throughout much of the Cold War. Angleton believed the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> and all
other spy networks to be so much gorgonzola, riddled with <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION>
moles. In his search for these moles Angleton paralysed large
chunks of the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> for years at a stretch and blighted the careers
of many senior officers.
   It was Angleton who insisted in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> that MI5 investigate
<PERSON>Harold Wilson</PERSON>, a task taken up enthusiastically by <PERSON>Peter Wright</PERSON> and
his circle in MI5. Angleton's overarching idiocy was to believe the
<ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> defector <PERSON>Golitsyn</PERSON>, who claimed that the friction between the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and Mao's <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE> was a fake to
deceive the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. Despite the collapse of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Golitsyn</PERSON> remains convinced that it is all a black propaganda ploy.
However, the confession of top <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> man <PERSON>Aldrich Ames</PERSON> that he was a
<ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> mole have proved some of <LOCATION>Angleton</LOCATION>'s fears correct.
   Believability: 6/10

   K IS FOR <LOCATION>KENNEDY</LOCATION>, killed by almost anyone you care to mention.
According to Captain <PERSON>James T Kirk</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Starship Enterprise</ORGANIZATION>, the
`first rule of assassination is kill the assassins'. The killing of
<PERSON>Lee Harvey Oswald</PERSON> by <PERSON>Jack Ruby</PERSON> set a hare running that has never
stopped. Instead of <ORGANIZATION>Oswald</ORGANIZATION>'s courtroom confession or denial of
guilt providing some explanation of the killing of the president,
the assassination of the assassin let conjecture reign.
   So many had a hand in his murder it is too tedious to name them
all. Oliver Stone argued in his film JFK that <PERSON>Lyndon Baines Johnson</PERSON>
was the man behind the conspiracy. The <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Mafia</LOCATION>, the Cubans,
the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> and the masons are all contenders. Perhaps the best JFK
conspiracy theory is that he is, after all, still alive, but kept a
permanent prisoner by the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION>.
   Believability: 1/10

   L IS FOR <LOCATION>LOCKERBIE</LOCATION>. On 21 <DATE>December 1988</DATE>, 270 people were
murdered when <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> 103 exploded over <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>.
   Six years later no one has been convicted of the crime, although
investigators on both sides of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> have consistently
pointed the finger at two Libyan intelligence officers who they
believe planted the bomb on a plane from <LOCATION>Malta</LOCATION> before it was
transferred at <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> on to the fatal flight. UN sanctions are
enforced against <ORGANIZATION>Tripoli</ORGANIZATION> until Colonel Gadaffi agrees to hand over
the two for trial.
   Others are not convinced by the official line. Tales of
suitcases of heroin recovered at the crash site by mysterious
American intelligence officers point to a joint <ORGANIZATION>CIA/Drug
Enforcement Administration</ORGANIZATION> operation that was fatally compromised
by Syrian and Iranian-backed Palestinian terrorists. American
spooks were running `controlled' deliveries of Lebanese heroin
through <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> airport in return for information about the
whereabouts of the hostages in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>. The terrorists were aware of
this and switched the dope-filled <ORGANIZATION>Samsonite</ORGANIZATION> case with one
containing the bomb. Among those killed were <PERSON>Matthew Gannon</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>'s deputy head of station in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>, and Major <PERSON>Charles McKee</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>Defence Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> officer allegedly in charge of a
hostage rescue team. Some students of the tragedy have gone so far
as to suggest that <PERSON>McKee</PERSON> was flying home to blow the whistle,
disgusted that deals were being struck with dope dealers in order
to gain intelligence on the kidnap victims.
   Believability: 8/10

   M IS FOR <PERSON>DAVID MELLOR</PERSON>, got at by <ORGANIZATION>Mossad</ORGANIZATION> after his
pro-Palestinian outburst in <DATE>1988</DATE> on the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION>. The Israelis
were out to topple <PERSON>Mellor</PERSON> after he became the most prominent critic
in the British Government of their conduct in the Occupied
Territories.
   First, they managed to secure his removal as junior Foreign
Office minister, threatening to stop passing on intelligence
information about the hostages in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> unless <PERSON>Mellor</PERSON> was moved.
   Second, they arranged for the clandestine phone-tapping
operation which led to the highly embarrassing `toe-sucking'
allegations.
   The result: <PERSON>Mellor</PERSON> was forced to quit the Cabinet.
   Believability: 5/10
  
   N IS FOR NOSTRADAMUS, the 16th- century psychic seer who
predicted <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> and the killing of <PERSON>John Kennedy</PERSON>. The
seer's muddily-written quatrains have spawned more than 200 books,
a propaganda war between the <LOCATION>Nazis</LOCATION> and the Allies during the Second
World War, a movie, an American TV spin-off show, Monopoly-style
board games, a virtual reality game and even a watch, which ticks
down the seconds from 1 <DATE>January 1995</DATE> to the millennium.
   Whitstable housewife <PERSON>Valerie Hewitt</PERSON>, author of Nostradamus: His
Key To The Centuries (<ORGANIZATION>Heinemann</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>1994</DATE>), predicts that Prince
<PERSON>Charles</PERSON> will be crowned this year. `It will be something sudden
that will affect the Queen, an illness " whether it is political or
genuine it doesn't matter. And <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> will be offered the chance to
become Queen. But <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>'s reign will be short and <PERSON>William</PERSON> could
be king before he's 18.' In <DATE>1993</DATE> she predicted that <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>
would stay as president.
   Rival Nostradamus buff <PERSON>John Hogue</PERSON> is more apocalyptic. He plumps
for nuclear disaster or terrorism in <DATE>1996</DATE>, World War III before the
millennium and Aids " `a very great plague . . . with a great scab'
" and the ozone hole killing off two-thirds of the world population.
   He quotes the prophet's vision of the future: `So many {die}
that no one will know the true owners of fields and houses. The
weeds in the city streets will rise higher than the knees, and
there shall be a total desolation of the clergy.' Believability:
0/10 (The verses of Nostradamus clearly refer to events and places
in the <DATE>16th century</DATE>. For example, nowhere does he mention `Hitler',
only `Hister', the contemporary name for the Lower Danube.)

   P IS FOR PROMIS SOFTWARE, stolen from a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> law firm. In
<DATE>1982</DATE> a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> DC computer firm, <ORGANIZATION>Inslaw</ORGANIZATION>, developed a programme
called Promis (Prosecutors' Management Information System) which it
supplied to the <ORGANIZATION>US Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>. A year
later, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> stopped all payments and <ORGANIZATION>Inslaw</ORGANIZATION> went bankrupt. A
ruling in <DATE>1987</DATE> at a bankruptcy court concluded that the <ORGANIZATION>Justice
Department</ORGANIZATION> `took, converted and stole Promis software through
trickery, fraud and deceit', which is a little embarrassing for the
department charged with upholding the rule of law.
   So far, so what? It is only when people started to probe into
why <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> had acted in such a way that it gets interesting,
prompting one investigator to claim that the case `was a lot
dirtier for the department than Watergate had been, both in its
breadth and depth'.
   It turns out that (allegedly) the men behind the theft of the
software were all <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> appointees who helped engineer the <DATE>1980</DATE>
`<DATE>October</DATE> Surprise', whereby the Republicans struck a deal with the
Iranians not to release <ORGANIZATION>American Embassy</ORGANIZATION> hostages from <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> until
after <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was safely in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. The software was then
sold on to foreign intelligence agencies across the globe, (a) to
generate revenue for covert operations not authorised by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>;
and (b) to make it easier for <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> operatives to hack into the
software.
   The story was chased by <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> freelance <PERSON>Danny Casolaro</PERSON>. A year
after making himself known to the <ORGANIZATION>Inslaw</ORGANIZATION> people he was found dead
in a motel room in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>. The official verdict was suicide,
but <PERSON>Elliott Richardson</PERSON>, the Attorney General under <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>, hired by
<ORGANIZATION>Inslaw</ORGANIZATION> to investigate the case, concluded: `It's hard to come up
with any reason for <PERSON>Casolaro</PERSON>'s death other than he was deliberately
murdered because he was so close to uncovering sinister elements in
what he called `the Octopus'.' Believability: 7/10

   Q IS FOR <PERSON>CARROLL QUIGLEY</PERSON>, the granddaddy of all modern American
conspiracists. Quigley's 1,340-page volume Tragedy And Hope "
History Of The World In Our Time (<DATE>1966</DATE>) included a dozen pages on
the existence of a hitherto unknown secret society, run by <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Lord Milner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lloyd George</PERSON>'s Chef de Cabinet, funded by <PERSON>Cecil
Rhodes</PERSON>'s estate. The group, said <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON>, who claimed to have
access to its papers, organised the Round Table groups in the
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Institute For International Affairs</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and its counterpart in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> betwen the wars.
   For far-Right groups such as the <ORGANIZATION>John Birch Society</ORGANIZATION> these pages
were proof, from an `insider', of the great conspiracy they had
always suspected. Not the communists, not the Jews, not even the
Illuminati, but the Perpetual Hidden Government " the PHG!
Quigley's revelations are behind much of the recent talk of One
Worlders and New World Orders and are part of Republican
presidential hopeful <PERSON>Pat Robertson</PERSON>'s world view. Among <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON>'s
students at <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, and the
conspiracists got quite excited when President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> referred to
the impact <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> made on him in his inauguration speech.
   Believability: 4/10

   R IS FOR <PERSON>JAMES RUSBRIDGER</PERSON>, killed and framed as a sex pervert by
MI5. Rusbridger was a tremendous irritant to the security services.
His letters to newspapers poured scorn on the Official Secrets Act;
his books, such as The Intelligence Game, cast doubt on the
official version of events. But where Rusbridger, aged 65 at the
time of his death, really annoyed the spooks was when he unearthed
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s code-cracking secrets, in particular the story that the
British had cracked Japanese naval codes in advance of the attack
on <LOCATION>Pearl Harbour</LOCATION>.  
   He was bright, hale and hearty for his age when he was
discovered in <DATE>February 1994</DATE> at his home, dressed in a green
protective suit for use in nuclear, biological or chemical warfare,
green overalls, a black plastic mackintosh and thick rubber gloves.
His face was covered by a gas mask and he was also wearing a
sou'wester. His body was suspended from two ropes, attached to
shackles fastened to a piece of wood across the open loft hatch,
and was surrounded by pictures of men and mainly black women in
bondage. Consultant pathologist Dr <PERSON>Yasai Sivathondan</PERSON> said he died
from asphyxia due to hanging `in keeping with a form of sexual
strangulation'.
   His death occasioned a piece by <ORGANIZATION>Sunday Times</ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON>James
Adams</PERSON>, whose own books boast of contacts with British intelligence.
Adams quoted senior intelligence officials as saying Rusbridger
never had any connection with any branch of British intelligence:
"His death was as much a fantasy as his life,' said one source . .
. Rusbridger's interest in intelligence seems to have coincided
with his conviction for theft in <DATE>1977</DATE>.' Such an extensive
posthumous demolition job by intelligence officials would perhaps
only be merited by someone who had been a serious thorn in their
side.

   S IS FOR THE SUICIDES OF THE SCIENTISTS WHO WORKED FOR MARCONI.
In <DATE>1988</DATE> a host of brilliant researchers working for the defence
giant killed themselves in a variety of ways: one drove his
petrol-laden car into a disused Little Chef, another jumped off the
<PERSON>Clifton</PERSON> suspension bridge, a third electrocuted himself.
   The deaths appeared to be a case of life imitating art " in this
case, an episode of the <DATE>1960s</DATE> Avengers series which features a
number of brilliant scientists killing themselves. The first
problem is that there was no linkage between the deaths. Second,
suicide is 10 times more common than murder in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. Third, men
kill themselves more violently than women. Fourth, scientists are
more ingenious than the rest of the population, so one would expect
them to kill themselves violently and bizarrely. Fifth, the defence
business employs huge numbers of scientists, and <ORGANIZATION>Marconi</ORGANIZATION> is a big
employer.
   When the numbers are crunched, there is no statistical
aberration in the number of suicides by Marconi scientists. It is
too good a story for a newspaper to kill, however.

   U IS FOR THE UNIFIED CONSPIRACY THEORY, or the <ORGANIZATION>Grand Unified
Conspiracy Theory</ORGANIZATION>, which knits all the other conspiracy theories
into a coherent tapestry.
   Believability: 1/10

   V IS FOR <ORGANIZATION>VATICAN</ORGANIZATION>, which knocks off the popes it doesn't like.
The markedly short reign of <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> I has given rise to this
particular crock of conjecture.
   Old men can die quite quickly, even if they are popes. However,
rumours persist in the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> than <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> I was going to clean
out the Augean stables of the pontiff's finances and expose the
scandalous links between the <LOCATION>Mafia</LOCATION>, the freemasons and senior
cardinals in the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>.

   W IS FOR <PERSON>COLIN WALLACE</PERSON>, who was forced to resign from the
<ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Defence</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE> when he leaked information about a
covert MI5 operation, `Clockwork Orange'. Wallace, an Ulsterman,
claimed he had been involved in the operation, which had been
designed to destabilise paramilitary organisations in the Province
through disinformation. Wallace alleged that the scope of the
operation had been extended to include mainland politicians viewed
as `politically soft or leftist', a list which included <PERSON>Harold
Wilson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edward Heath</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeremy Thorpe</PERSON>. Wallace claims it was in
his remit to discredit these `targets' using unfounded smear
stories about sexual impropriety.
   He also alleged, in a memo to army chiefs, that a <LOCATION>Belfast</LOCATION> boys'
home named <PERSON>Kincora</PERSON> was being used as a homosexual trap for
intelligence gathering against prominent Unionist politicians. In
<DATE>1990</DATE> an inquiry conducted by <PERSON>James Calcutt</PERSON> QC found <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON>'s
dismissal to be unsafe and ordered the Ministry to award him
pounds 30,000 in compensation. The inquiry was not, however,
empowered to make any judgment on <ORGANIZATION>Wallace</ORGANIZATION>'s allegations.
   Believability: 7/10

   X IS FOR <PERSON>MR X</PERSON>, the third man who allegedly went to bed with two
senior Conservative politicians, now in the Cabinet, all at the
same time. This is a conspiracy theory never to be told.
   Believability: 10/10

   Y IS FOR YAKUZA, the Japanese mafia who run the world. The
Yakuza are the world's richest and most powerful gangsters. They
control many of the big-name Japanese corporations that now have
huge leverage in the major western economies. Nothing can be done
to loosen the grip of the Yakuza on the world economy.
   Believability: 8/10

   Z IS FOR THE <LOCATION>ZAGREB</LOCATION> OPERATION, when the <ORGANIZATION>NKVD</ORGANIZATION> inducted <PERSON>Robert
Maxwell</PERSON> as a Soviet double agent. Maxwell was never clear about how
he escaped from Nazi-occupied <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. In fact, he was given secret
passage through Nazi-allied <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> by Communist partisans, then
loyal to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, in return for a lifetime as a spy.
   While passing through <PERSON>Zagreb Maxwell</PERSON> was recruited by an officer
of the <ORGANIZATION>NKVD</ORGANIZATION> " the forerunner to the <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> " and was told to travel to
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and ingratiate himself with the British Establishment.
<PERSON>Maxwell</PERSON> did brilliantly, becoming first a war hero then a respected
publisher. The <ORGANIZATION>NKVD</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> helped <PERSON>Maxwell</PERSON> out from time to time,
smoothing his path in arranging deals with <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Bloc</ORGANIZATION> scientific
publishers and the like. Maxwell prospered.
   It was only in <DATE>1991</DATE> that the Israeli secret service, <LOCATION>Mossad</LOCATION>,
came across the truth when they bought up a senior <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> archivist
who sold them the Operation <LOCATION>Zagreb</LOCATION> file. Maxwell " who Mossad
thought had been working for them " was terminated by a crack unit
of Israeli frogmen.
